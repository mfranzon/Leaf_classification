# Leaf Classification
This repository contains:
* a [dataset](https://github.com/mfranzon/leaf_classification/blob/master/leaf.csv) of leaves measures, 15 variables and 30 classes 
* a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00288/) of leaves images in RGB, 40 classes
* a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00288/) of leaves images in BW scale, 36 classes 

 
# Aim 
Make a model that predict plant species through leaves dimensions in R enviroment. Folder [Models](https://github.com/mfranzon/leaf_classification/tree/master/Models)

Realize a image classifier to predcit plant species through leaves images. **Work in progress**
